# dev-java-web-mill-spring-thyme-crypto-postgres-simple

## Description
A springboot secure web app with thymeleaf support.
Three roles are defined; USER, ADMIN, and SUPER. All roles
can access pages `/home`, `/login`, and `/about`. Only USER
can access `/user` and ADMIN only `/admin` whereas SUPER can
navigate to either and have its own `/super`. Each role
has an action USER=VIEW ONLY, ADMIN=READ/WRITE, SUPER=CREATE.
All password are encoded with bcrypt.

Data IS NOT persistent but will write to a database. This
will let springboot create and drop tables.
